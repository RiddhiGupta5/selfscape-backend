# Selfscape ~ your perfect mood analyst

A web application that can help you monitor and track your mood by providing you with insights on your behavioural patterns. The analysis will be through a color-coordinated graph, based on your interests and daily diary entries, along with an in-built activity suggester chatbot to guide you better as per your mood.

## Our Idea

During these trying times, often we neglect our well-being and state of mind due to the extremely busy lives. Since people are finding themselves to be more lethargic in their free time than usual, the application can help suggest activities the user can perform to stay productive and elated. 

Through this, we can monitor mood swings and unexpected behavioural changes by maintaining a log of our emotions on a daily basis and judge the pattern that occurs over a particular time period. This would enable us to take appropriate actions to keep our moods elated at all times while making the most of the time at home and getting a break from the monotonous schedule.

## How does it exactly work?

1. Create an account by signing up at Selfscape.
2. Add your own interests, hobbies and routine commitments, category-wise under Leisure, Learning or Productivity.
3. Maintain your diary logs and entries by entering your mood range (from 1-10) for that particular day and a brief description if you wish to.
4. Our virtual assistant can help you by suggesting activities and how to make your day more lively and productive.
5. Keep a check on your day-to-day mood swings through a well-maintained and color co-ordinated graph analysis.
